                        <h4>About Sambar...</h4>
                        <p>Sambar is a South Indian stew made with lentils, mixed vegetables, tamarind, herbs, spices & a special aromatic spice powder known as sambar powder. This spice powder is the key to make a good sambar. A variety of spices & lentils are used to make this powder. Most traditional homes make their own sambhar masala powder to suit their taste buds.</p>

                        <p>In the modern times, many people prefer to buy the store bought powder as it is convenient. I avoid buying any spice powders and prefer to make my own for the best aroma and taste.</p>

                         <img class="img-fluid" src=" {{ url_for('static', filename='assets/img/sambar-recipe.jpg')}}"/>
                         <p>Most times I make the instant powder while the dal cooks as nothing beats the aroma of fresh roasted & ground sambar powder.In this post I have also shared the recipe of sambar powder just enough for this sambar recipe. So I suggest making the sambhar powder too while you cook the dal as it is more flavorful, hygienic & you know what goes into it.</p>

                         <p>You also can check this post on<a href="https://www.indianhealthyrecipes.com/sambar-masala-powder-recipe/"> how to make sambar powder </a> if you prefer to stock up for a month or two. If you have the powder ready, it is very quick to make the vegetable sambhar anytime.</p>

                        <p><h5>Making Sambar :</h5></p>
                        <p>There are different ways a sambar is made. But as I mentioned this is my mom’s recipe so I make the same way and always felt every step I shared below is the key to enhance the flavour and taste quotient.
                        <br>
                        1.The first step is to pressure cook lentils until soft and mushy. You can either pressure cook or cook them in a pot.
                        <br>
                        2.The second step is to cook mixed vegetables until tender in lots of water.
                        <br>
                        3.Then the third step is to simmer the vegetable stock with sambar powder.
                        <br>
                        4.Next dal is mixed and simmered briefly to mingle with the amazing flavors.
                        <br>
                        5.Lastly an aromatic tempering is done to give a final touch to the sambar. This is done by frying the spices & herbs in pure ghee or oil & poured over the cooked sambhar.
