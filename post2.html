                        <p>About Shaahi Paneer…...</p>
                        <p>Shahi paneer is a Mughlai dish where paneer is cooked in a creamy gravy made of onions, yogurt, nut and seeds. As the name suggests, Shahi Paneer literally means Paneer for the royalty. So it is cooked with ingredients that impart a richness to the dish like yogurt, cream, nuts and seeds.<br>

                        This is one of the few vegetarian recipes you’ll find in the traditional Mughlai cuisine other than desserts which brings us to a popular and rich regional cuisine made popular by restaurants across India.<br>

                        Mughlai cuisine was developed during the reign of the Mughals in India by the Khansaamas (chefs serving in the royal kitchens). This cuisine is based on Persian and central Asian cuisines with distinct Indian influences.<br>

                        Few things set apart Mughlai dishes from other foods. The rich and creamy texture, complex flavors, use of whole spices, meal fragrances in the form of rose and kewra water, and most importantly, the technique of slow cooking.<br>

                        These dishes are predominately meat based with culinary creations like Akbari dal (made with urad dal and yogurt) and shahi paneer being some of the exceptions.

                        This cuisine developed centuries ago has changed Indian attitudes towards foods and has introduced us to new flavors and food combinations.<br>

                        Shahi Paneer is made in two ways – the old-style without tomatoes (as these were introduced much later in India by the Portuguese and British colonists) and the modern restaurant style with tomatoes which comes closer to this paneer butter masala.

                        <p><h5>Steps to make shaahi paneer.....</h5></p>
                        <p>1. If you’re using store bought paneer, soak it in warm water for 15 to 20 minutes and pat dry. You can optionally fry the paneer pieces in a little oil or ghee if you like. Put the fried paneer cubes in hot water for about 15 mins to soften them.<br>

                        2. Heat one tablespoon of ghee in a saucepan on medium. Add 12 whole or split cashews, 8 almonds and 2 to 3 green cardamoms. Shallow fry them for 1 to 2 mins, and be careful not to burn them.<br>

                        3. Add 1 cup of cubed onions and 1 slit green chilli. Sauté until the onions turn transparent. If you prefer hot and spicy shahi paneer, use green chili at this stage. If you prefer a tomato based dish then add the optional cubed tomatoes (1 or 2) if using.<br>

                        4.Cook the onion and nut mixture until the onions turn soft. Add a little water or oil if the mixture sticks to the pan. Remove from heat and cool completely. Transfer all the ingredients to a grinder jar.<br>

                        5.Blend this mixture with minimal water to make a smooth and thick paste. Do not add a lot of water as we don’t want a runny paste. We don’t want any coarse nuts in the paste so make sure it is as smooth as possible.<br>

                        6. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil or ghee in the same pan. Add ½ teaspoon of cumin (jeera) or shahi jeera, 2 to 3 cloves and 1 to 2-inch cinnamon to the oil. On a low heat, sauté the whole spices for one minute until they turn fragrant.<br>

                        7. Now add 1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste and sauté it well for 1 to 2 minutes, until the raw smell goes off.<br>

                        8. Next add the onion-nut paste along with these:<br>
                        ¼ teaspoon of red chili powder<br>
                        ¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala<br>
                        ⅛ teaspoon turmeric (optional)<br>
                        ½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)<br>

                        9. Stir well to combine and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the raw smell of the spices goes away. The mixture turns thick as you cook. In the meantime, beat ½ cup of thick curd/plain yogurt in a bowl with a fork or whisk until creamy and smooth. Lower the heat to low and slowly add the beaten curd.<br>

                        Tip: To avoid the yogurt from splitting you can also add a few tablespoons of cooked onion nut masala to the bowl of yogurt. Mix well to combine and then add it to the pan. This way the yogurt won’t split.<br>

                        10. Let the shahi paneer gravy cook until it becomes thick and starts to leave the sides of the pan.<br>

                        11. Add ½ to ¾ cup of water. Add the pinch of saffron strands, if you’re using it. Mix well add more water if required to make a runny gravy.<br>

                        12. Cook the shahi paneer gravy until it thickens or the gravy releases oil or ghee on the surface. Taste test the gravy and add more salt or spices, if desired. For a mild heat, I add a slit green chilli at this stage instead of adding it with the onions.<br>

                        When your gravy is perfect in consistency and texture, add 1½ cups of cubed paneer (around 225 to 250 grams). Cook on low heat for about 1 to 2 minutes. If using fried paneer don’t cook any longer. Turn off the heat.
